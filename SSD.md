### Solid-state drive 


## [[Block_dev|Block devices]] Limitations
- Data can be read only on **empty** [[Block_dev#page|pages]]
- *Erasing* can only be than at the [[Block_dev|block level]] 

### Trimming
TRIM is a command with the help of which the operating system can tell the solid state drive ([[SSD]]) which data blocks are no longer needed and can be deleted, or are marked as free for rewriting
- Instead of deleting hole blocks of memory it enables to delete [[Block_dev#page|pages]]
- Whenever a delete command is issued by the operating system or the user, the [[SSD]] automatically sends a TRIM command to wipe the storage space being erased.
