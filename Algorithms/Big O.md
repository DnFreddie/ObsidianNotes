## Big O
*How many steps does it take to execute*
Its the wat to categorize algortihms  *time or memory requaierments based on the input*
>[!tip] look for loops :)
>signular loop is one O fo N 

- growth with respecet to input 
- constans does not matter 
- worst case is tpyically a measure    
- Its not meannt to be an exact measument '
	- it genaralaizes the growth of your algorithm 
		- Example :
			- Oh of N means that the algorithm will gorw linearly based on the input  
		- **Why to use it**
			- It helps us make deciosion about what *data structers and algortihms to use*
				- Knwoing the performence it helps to generate the best outcome 
- ** The data structers are design to have the best outcom in a given usage if u  use them incorelcy the lower the performance**

## Big O Types
- O squere ("*usually loop inside the loop*")
	**O (N^2)**

>[!tip] If the input halves itsel at each step,its likely *O of (LogN) or O(NlogN)*
	
- O(n log n)
	- [quick sort](/Algorithms/quick sort.md)
- O(log n)
	- [[Binary search trees]]
