## Binary Search 
- We split the value in half to up to the point we find it 
	- its basically an logarithm so the run time is **O(log n)**
	- List has to be **ordered** 

### Implementation 
We find middle  point 
*high is exclusive low is inclusive*
```go

search(array,low,high)
midpoint = low +(hi-low)/2
value = [[Static Array]][m]
if value = n  
return true 
else if  v > m 
low = m+1

else 
n = m 


```

#codingProblem 
## Two crystal balls problem 
- First we drop one ball in the middle point to check weather it breaks 
- *Remember that list has to be ordered*
	- if it breaks we check the lower portion of an array 
	- if it doesnt  we go higher
