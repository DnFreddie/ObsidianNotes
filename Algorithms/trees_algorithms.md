## Trees 
*All roads leads to trees*
**Terminology**
- Root
	- The most parent node (*the first Adam*)
- Height
	- The *lognest path* from root to the most child node
- Binary tree 
	- A tree in which has *at most 2 children*
		- It ussual has *lef* and *right* as a name for the children 
- General tree
	- A tree in which has *at most 2 children*
- Binary search-tree 
	- *Specyfic ordering*
	- A tree in which has *at most 2 children*
- Leavs
	- node without the children
- Balanced 
	- A tree is ==perfecly balacned== when any node's **lef and right children** have **the same height**
	- The more balanced the better the algorithm
- Branching Factor 
	- The amount of children a tree has
