## Recursion 
*The function calles itself until it reaches ==base case==*



"*Friedns dont let friends recurse  without a toolbox*"


- Base case is an instance whent the fucntion no longer calls itsef instead it returns value 
	- *Always vernalize the base case correcly*
	- Only then Recourse 

- **Recurse Steps**

	- Pre (recurse )
		- n+
	- Recurse 
	- Post (recurse)


- s
	- Retrun address
		- Every time the function is called it needs to know how it got here becouse it has to *hand in the value back* 
	- Return Value 
		- The space for value that is beeing return 
	- [[Arguments]] 
		- The arguments u pass in to the function
