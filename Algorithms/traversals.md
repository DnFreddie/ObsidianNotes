## Traversals
The running time of thhi operaiton is **O of N**
*Doing the treversal we use [[stack_algorithms]]*
The value gets put on the stack ones it not fiind we pop it and move it to the next branch

## Depth first search
-  Ways to try a visit every single node
	
	- **Pre order**
		- U first visit the node then i do the recursion 
		- ==root at the begining==
	- **In odrder** 
		- We recurse to the last elemnt of the tree side then add the middle point and recurse left
		- ==root at the middle==
	- **Postorder** we do recursion then we visit the  node 
		- *post order is good to clear the data on a way out*
		- ==root at the end==

## Breadth first seatch
Oposite of a depth first search 
- We use [[queue_algorithms]] **instead** of [[stack_algorithms]] 
- Its a **tree level visiting**
	One tree level at a time
