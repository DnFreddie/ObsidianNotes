### Integral windup
- Theres a huge problem with reducing the error later 
	-  It builds staedli and then **satuarte the distance**
>[!tip]- imagine a drone
>When u holding it the error is rising since it canot achive the desiersed hight 
>The enging increase there power 
>When u lwt it go the speed is to high and so the error that it canot steadl achive the desierd hight 


==Methods to fix it==



#### Clamping 

Turning the **integrator off**
Baislcy we set up a given error 
if the error meets its limit 
must we do not increase It 
instead we steadly incerase the speed to the point that we can overcome the obstacle (*if we reach the max limit we migh consider a slow down lets say or stoping*) we slow down the speed so we dont overshoult those 20 km per hour
- rember about the non perfect sesnr 
- Think about the dynaimc error
