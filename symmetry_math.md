## Understanding symmetry 

The symmetry of the object is when despite applying changes to the potion it remains unchanged

Evry transforamtion is called symetrics 
>[!example]-
> If you leave my office for a minute, and I turn the round table by
any angle, you won’t notice the difference. 
But if I do the same to the square table, you will, unless I turn it by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.”


- ==Identity==( $0\degree$ )
	-  This is a special
	symmetry because it actually does nothing to our object: each point of the table ends up in exactly the same position as it was before.


- Rotation  by any angel greater then $360\degree$ is equal to rotation by angel between 0 $360\degree$
	- *Example* Rotation by $450\degree$ is equal to  the same rotation as $90\degree$ 
	- ($450\degree =360\degree +90\degree$)
- If we apply two rotations-one after another we obtaine another rotation 
	*{90◦, 180◦ , 270◦ , 360◦ }*
- point of the circle represents a particular rotation of the round table.

 - The rotations of a point  are represented by corresponding rotation of infinite circle
