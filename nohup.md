If you want to have a process continue even if the terminal window it was launched from is closed, you need a way to intercept the SIGHUP so that the program never receives it.

*Actually, the terminal window doesn't launch processes, they're launched by the shell session inside the terminal window.*

The simple and elegant solution to that problem is to place another process between the shell session and the program, and have that middle-layer program never pass on the SIGHUP signal.
