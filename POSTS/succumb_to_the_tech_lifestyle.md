Nowadays, there are many movements and lifestyles to follow: alpha, sigma, red pill, woke, leftist, rightist. But nobody says anything about the technicians.

<br>


**Can IT professionals beat the alpha male?**

<br>

I know, I know you think that people who spend most of their time behind a screen, repairing printers and watching anime, can't be equal to *Andrew Tate* or any other self-proclaimed guru.

You might see us as a bunch of [quiche  eating  nerds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_594mPXoHMI) who have no lives or girlfriends.

But think again. **We're the Davids in this battle, and we all know how that story ends**.

### We're the Builders

**When was the last time you built something?**

Not just blindly copied data into an Excel sheet or sent an email, but truly created something?

Creation is one of our primary human instincts.

It's the feeling that something is truly yours, that you have control over it.

**As IT professionals, we create things every day.**

It doesn't matter how shitty it is.

Your code might not be optimized; a simple for-loop might take two hours to run.

*But it's yours.*

From automation scripts to building computers from scratch, we are constantly creating.

We even build the web so you can brag about your problems and sell your  ponzi schemes.

**We're the builders.**

### We Love Our Tools

Emacs, Vim, Linux, Windows, React, Solid, Ranger, vifm we know them inside and out.

While most people watch Netflix in their free time, we tinker with configuration files.

*It's our fetish.*

But oh boy, how smooth the experience is.

Our world is all about **DX** (*Developer Experience*) and positive laziness. 

**We love automation.**

Do you think all these dotfiles are moved manually?

For every action you do, we have a bot, a shortcut, or a script ready.

*One day, we will automate everything so thoroughly that we won't be needed anymore...*

### We're the learners 

![Obsidian setup](/blog_imgs/sucumb_to_tech/obsidian_setup.jpeg)

I'm sure you've thought at least once in your life that what you learn in school won't help you in the real world.

*There's no such thought here because there's no school. It's just you and your text editor.*

It's truly liberating because you find the purpose for learning.

**You learn because you want solve your problem, not just to pass a test.**

The hands-on experience is constantly intertwined with theoretical knowledge.

We seek knowledge and have unlimited resources #Google. 

Here,you're never hopeless.

**But really read the f... manual**

If you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed, you can always find a way to abstract the problem.

We use abstraction to not just solve issues but to simplify and transform complex concepts into manageable, understandable pieces.

U see one day the abstraction will literally blow your mind.

### We are the community

People might dive in, gushing about tools and programming languages, but when they see you creating, they're always ready to help.

**It doesn't matter what you've done before. What matters is that now you're one of us.**

We love to see new faces and fresh ideas.

We have countless Discord channels and communities where we share and collaborate, embracing everyone who joins.

My friend  used to say, *"IT is such a broad field that it will accept anyone"* and that's what ultimately drew me to this mentality.

**Here, you'll find what you love because we have it all.**

From stereotypical programming to UX development, system administration, data science, and tech marketing.

Pick your poison,

**You don't have to be a programmer**.

There are plenty of roles that don't require coding.

*What we need from you is to succumb  to the tech lifestyle.*


#### To sum up 
I hope you've picked your champion  because the evidence is overwhelming...

Either way, peace out for now.

Future projects won't build themselves

PS:
Looking forward to the epic rap battle between the [Primogen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen/featured) and Andrew Tate!
