Eyes of the skin

Overhead music flows in a compressed stream 
author detaches itself from visibility 
bit by bit small vibrations land themselves on the eyebrow 
causing it to shut 
parr of blue eyes passes through the body of darkness 
coolness of glass
dryness of gin 
embodiment of tongue 
figs start to reveal their micro-treasures 
almond oil soothes the taste
the heat is pouring out all over my head  
though I feel
I can't recall
words structured   sensation
