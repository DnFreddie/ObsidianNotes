## Trusted Platform Module

Specialized hardware component or microcontroller 
- provides secure cryptographic functions and stores cryptographic keys and measurements to establish and maintain a trusted computing environment.


## Roles of TPM 
1. **Secure Boot**: TPMs can be used to ensure that the system starts up using trusted and verified software components, preventing unauthorized or tampered code from running during the boot process.
    
2. **Key Management**: TPMs can generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys securely. These keys can be used for various purposes, such as encrypting data, signing digital certificates, or establishing secure connections using protocols like TLS.
    
3. **Remote Attestation**: TPMs support a feature called remote attestation, where a system can prove its integrity and configuration to a remote party. This can be useful for establishing trust between systems in a network.
    
4. **Secure Communication**: TPMs can be used in conjunction with cryptographic protocols to securely store and manage keys required for establishing secure communication channels like [TLS_SSL](/protocols/TLS_SSL.md) connections. This ensures that keys are protected from unauthorized access or tampering.
    
5. **Data Integrity and Sealing**: TPMs can seal data, ensuring that it can only be decrypted and accessed on the same system where it was originally created. This helps protect sensitive data from being moved to other systems without proper authorization.
