## Revolutions per minute
 A unit that measures the **rotational speed** or the number of times a rotary component completes a full $360\degree$ rotation in one minute.

When someone says a robot part (like a wheel or a motor) operates at "100 RPM," they mean that part completes 100 full rotations every minute.
