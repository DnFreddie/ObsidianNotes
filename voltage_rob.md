## Voltage  

 - Pressure that drives electric charges through a circuit
 
- As the electric charges flow through the circuit, they encounter
	resistances, such as *wires* or other components. These **resistances**
	slow down the flow of charges 
	 - The relationship
		between the [voltage_rob](/voltage_rob.md), [current_rob](/current_rob.md), and [resistance_rob](/resistance_rob.md) can be described by
		**Ohm's Law** which states that voltage equals current multiplied by
		resistance $(V = IR)$
