## Resistance 

- The more resistance in a circuit, the lower the voltage will be across the resistor.
- Think of it like water
	flowing through a pipe. 
	- If the pipe is narrow (high resistance), the water pressure (voltage) will be lower. If the pipe is wide (lowresistance), the water pressure will be higher.
