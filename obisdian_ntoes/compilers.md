## Compilers 
- The binary  instructions are
written in machine language, an elementary language the [Cpu](/obisdian_ntoes/notes_obsidian/Linux/Kernel/Cpu.md) can understand. 
- Compilers are designed to translate the language of C code into machine language for a variety of *processor architectures*.

### Processor Architacture 

1. x86 architecture
2. Sparc processor architectures                              (used in Sun Workstations)
3. PowerPC processor architecture                           (used in pre-Intel Macs)

### Examine Binaries 

Use [objdump](/obisdian_ntoes/objdump.md)
