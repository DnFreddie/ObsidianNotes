### Main tasks
-   Spliting memory into subdevisons
-   **[[processes_kernel]]**

-   The kernel is responsible for determining which processes are allowed to use the CPU.

-   **Memory**
	-   The kernel needs to keep track of all memory—what is currently allocated to a particular process,
	    
	    what might be shared between processes, and what is free.  
	    

-   **Device drivers**
	-   The kernel acts as an interface between hardware (such as a disk) and processes. It’s
	    
	    usually the kernel’s job to operate the hardware.  
	    

-   **System calls and support**
	-   [[processes_kernel]] normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel.
