## Grants the permmison to the group 
**The SGID bit is represented as 2 before the regular permissions**
>[!example] The SGID bit is represented as 2 before the regular permissions

new file with the resulting permissions 644 would be represented as 2644 when
the SGID bit is set. Again, you would use the chmod command for this—for
example, *chmod 2644 filename*.
## To a file
This means that,
with an SGID bit set, someone without execute permission can execute a file if
the owner belongs to the group that has permission to execute that file
## To directory 
Ownership of new files created in that directorygoes to the directory creator’s group, rather than the file creator’s group.
- This is very useful when a directory is shared by multiple users. All users in that group can execute the file(s), not just a single user.
