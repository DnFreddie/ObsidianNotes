SQL lets us do this through a command called [`LEFT JOIN`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/left-join?page_ref=catalog). A _left join_ will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table.

>[!example]
>SELECT *  
FROM table1  
LEFT JOIN table2  
  ON table1.c2 = table2.c2;
