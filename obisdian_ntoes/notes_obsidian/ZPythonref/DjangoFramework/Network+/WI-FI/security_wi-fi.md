## Security 
*This is the security protocol used on the Wi-Fi AP that is
being read from. There are three primary security protocols for Wi-Fi.*
- The original, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), was badly flawed and eas-ily cracked.
	- Its replacement, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), was a bit moresecure. 
		- Finally, WPA2-PSK, which is much more secure and uses a pre-shared key (PSK) that all users share, is now used by nearly all Wi-FiAPs (except enterprise Wi-Fi).
