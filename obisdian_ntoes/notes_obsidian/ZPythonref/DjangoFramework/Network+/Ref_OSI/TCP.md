#alt-name streaming protocol 
## Transmission Control Protocol
It makes sure that data is transmmited in reaiable way 

[[PAR]]
- <mark style="background: #72083D;">TCP is a connection base system </mark>
	- U have to establisch the connetion with the device to send the packet 
- **Ordering**
	- Tcp headers contains *sequence numbers* so if the data get out of order during the transportation 
	- If the packet is *missing* we can request for the lost one 
- **Flow Control** 
	- The reciver can manage how much data is sent
