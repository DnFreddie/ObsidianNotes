#def 
Method of inquriy which aims at testing hypotheses by manipulating cartian phenomenon while controling for others factor 


## How to design
- Treatment manipuylating independent varaible 
- control group 
- dependent vriables 
- experimental group
-


**Internal Validitiy**
The degree to which results are attribiuted to the independent varaible and not some other rival expenation 
*Risk, opportunities and threats to internal validity*
- History , past  and prior expirience of subject 
- The learning curve 
- Repeated mesures (pre + post testing )
- Any changes in measures 
- Selection bias 
- Decomposition of a smaple 
- Randomization 
- Manipulation checks 
- The double-blind study




**External Validity**
The extent to which the resualts of study can be generaliezd 

*Risk, opportunities and threats to external validity*

- Placebo effect 
- Hawthorne effect 
- Order effects /carry ove effects 
- controlo groups 
- randomization 
- ecological validity 

## Steps in a study

- Itroduction of breifing 
- Manipulation 
- Dependent varieables 
- Manipulation 
- Dependet variables 
- Dquality control 
- Mediator nad moderators 
- Potentail cofunds/and filter iteams 
- manipulation check
- SOciodemgoraphics 
- Supipcion probe / debtefing 

**Rewasarch method**

*Expoloration* 
Much of social reasearch is conducted to explore a topic that is , to start familarize a researcher with the topic .
This approach typicyly occurs when a reasearcher examines a new interes or when the subject of study itself 

*Explanation*
To expleain things 
*Description*
many soicial scientific studies aim at descripion

Intervies are diffren and can have diffrent forms 
- Spontaneous vs standaralized
- Direct vs indirect 
- Indvidual vs group

*Group intervies = including = controling disscusions* 



**FGI help in : 
- getting data on sensitive /diffcult subject eg. needs , bew products 
	- Qualitastive evalutations e.g. new ideas  and extracting impicate judgments are insprationa intellectually .
